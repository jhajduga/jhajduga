# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a passionate **medical physicist, researcher, academic teacher, programmer, and photographer** currently pursuing a PhD at AGH University of Science and Technology.

## ðŸ“š About me
- ðŸŽ“ Teaching **C, C++, basic computer science, and laboratories focused on ionizing radiation dosimetry in medicine**, especially the analysis of simulation data and the practical use of simulations in medical applications.
- ðŸ§ª My doctoral research involves the development of a simulation platform (**Dose-3D**) aimed at accurately modeling **spatial radiation dose distributions** within medical phantoms.
- ðŸ’» Experienced with:
  - C/C++, Python (and I'm working on getting to know Julia)
  - Geant4 simulations
  - Git and CMake
- ðŸ”¬ Specializing in **medical physics**, particularly focused on developing **3D-printed phantoms** for radiology and radiotherapy applications.

## ðŸš€ Current projects
- Development of the **Dose-3D phantom** and related simulation tools.
- Exploring efficient visualization techniques for complex 3D data.
- Creating innovative educational resources and engaging assignments for my students.
- Enhancing my personal website (**work in progress**) to better share projects and research findings.
